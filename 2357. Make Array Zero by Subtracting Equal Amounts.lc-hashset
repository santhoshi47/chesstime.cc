class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set=new HashSet<>();
        for(int n:nums)
        {
            if(n!=0)
            set.add(n);
        }
    return set.size();
    }}
    
    
    
    
    The key to solving this question is to realize that we are trying to find the number of different non-zero elements. We can achieve this by using a HashSet.
    hashset doesnt contain any duplicates,so size can be returned.
